"Defeat the Evil Wizard" by Nicholas Yaeger.

Note: I added variance to damage (most attacks can vary by +/- 10%)
    Attacks also have a 10% chance to miss (except for the Paladin's Holy Strike)

1. Choose a class for your character:
    * Warrior: High HP. 
        The Warrior can make a power attack, dealing more damage now, for less damage for the next few turns.
        The Warrior can also make a parrying attack, reducing their damage for the attack, and halving damage they take.
    * Mage: Higher attack.
        The Wizard has two spells to cast: a fire spell that continues to deal damage, and a sleep spell that may put their target to sleep.
        A sleeping foe has a 50/50 chance to wake up every turn. They also wake up if they take damage.
    * Archer: Middle attack and HP
        The Archer can make quick attacks, attacking twice in one turn.
        They can also evade, dodging the next attack.
    * Paladin: Warrior HP and attack.
        The Paladin can make a Holy Strike, dealing extra damage and bypassing accuracy checks to always hit.
        The Paladin can also use a holy shield, to make the next damaging attack deal 0 damage.

2. Name the character
3. Fight the evil wizard.
    * All classes have an attack, two special abilities, and a heal.
    * The heal ability starts at healing 75% of health, but lowers by 1/6th each use. After 6 uses, the heal doesn't recover anything.
        * The warrior recovers from exhaustion twice as fast from exhaustion when using the heal, but not when the 6th use has previously been expended
    * The Evil Wizard has two more passive abilities:
        * Pressure: The Evil Wizard deals more damage the longer the battle goes.
        * Critical hit: Any attack the Evil Wizard makes that hits has a 10% chance to deal double damage.
